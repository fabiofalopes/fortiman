| Description | This article describes how to choose a suitable FortiOS version. |
| --- | --- |
| Scope | FortiGate. |
| Solution | Common clarification when planning to choose the FortiOS version suitable for each environment:  1. As an initial step, ensure that the firewall is running a supported FortiOS version according to the [**Product Life Cycle**](https://support.fortinet.com/support/#/lifecycle) for the FortiGate equipment.   	It is **necessary** to update/upgrade to a supported FortiOS version to seek help. 2. Each FortiOS version (7.6.x; 7.4.x; 7.2.x; 7.0.x) has different features and is **NOT** compatible with all models of FortiGate equipment. Verify the update/upgrade eligibility of the selected FortiOS version of each device specified under the version [Release Notes -> Supported Models](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.4.0/fortios-release-notes/760203/introduction-and-supported-models). 3. The first two digits (**7.6**.x; **7.4**.x; **7.2**.x; and **7.0**.x) of the FortiOS represent the version while the **x** digit represents the patch of the current version. 4. It is recommended to maintain the latest patch of the selected version to be compliant with the latest vulnerabilities that are announced in [Release Notes -> Resolved Issues -> Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.4.0/fortios-release-notes/289806/resolved-issues)  in accordance with  [PSIRT Advisories](https://fortiguard.com/psirt%C2%A0). 5. When upgrading to the newer supported version (for example: from 7.0.x to 7.6.x, from 7.2.x to 7.6.x, from 7.4.x to 7.6.x, from 7.0.x to 7.2.x, from 7.0.x to 7.4.x, or from 7.2.x to 7.4.x): - Does **NOT** necessarily denote that is more secure version unless a clear instruction is suggested by the TAC Representative or [PSIRT Advisories](https://fortiguard.com/psirt%C2%A0). - Does **NOT** necessarily address a vulnerability concern, unless a clear instruction is suggested by the TAC Representative or [PSIRT Advisories](https://fortiguard.com/psirt%C2%A0). - A [FortiConverter Service](https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/data-sheets/FortiConverter.pdf) license is required whenever the [Upgrade Path](http://How%20to upgrade FortiGate firmware.) cannot be respected. (Configuration can get corrupted if the upgrade path is not followed strictly). - Upgrades should be planned accordingly. 1. Having an [HA Cluster](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.4.5/administration-guide/900885) is always recommended as a suitable business continuity requirement. 2. When ready, strictly follow the instructions of the following article: [How to upgrade FortiGate firmware.](https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-How-to-upgrade-FortiGate-firmware/ta-p/194980) Make sure to acknowledge the advice provided in the Usage awareness and preparation checklist before the upgrade section.  Involving a TAC Support Representative:  1. The TAC Representative is not equipped to recommend any stable patch or version. That decision falls solely to the client's technical team based on the environment and features in use. 2. The TAC Representative is not advised to be on standby nor perform the updates/upgrades on the team's behalf. This responsibility falls solely to the client's technical team. 3. In cases where a faulty [FortiGate firmware upgrade](https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-How-to-upgrade-FortiGate-firmware/ta-p/194980) was performed, request immediate support through the phone to the toll-free numbers (see [Fortinet Contact Support Information](https://www.fortinet.com/support/contact)) for extensive troubleshooting available 24/7.
