# Secure Networking with FortiLink

FortiLink is an innovative proprietary management protocol, enabling seamless integration and centralized management between a FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall and the FortiSwitch Ethernet switching platform. FortiLink transforms the FortiSwitch into a logical extension of the FortiGate, streamlining the management of both Ethernet data center and network security functions via a unified interface. Offering high performance with low latency, FortiGate NGFW and FortiSwitch campus core and data center switching can support the demands of high-speed traffic inspection and segmentation.

# Segmentation and Policy Enforcement

FortiSwitch campus core and data center switching architecture can augment and further the security policies at the FortiSwitch access switch layer and enable high-speed data traffic segmentation through FortiLink. This process grants IT administrators control over traffic within segments and limits threat exposure. Policy enforcement is simplified, while next-generation firewall (NGFW)-level policies ensure effective security at the core of your network.

# SASE

The FortiSwitch enterprise architecture establishes a foundation for zero-trust network access (ZTNA) and secure access service edge (SASE), offering flexibility in deploying the desired level of security at the network edge.

# Operational Simplicity

FortiSwitch switching architecture enables secure deployment and management within minutes through zero-touch deployment. Whether in standalone or FortiLink mode, automation and orchestration offer intuitive workflows and unified views for provisioning, management, and optimization, accessible through both FortiCloud and on-premises management.

Centralized management provides a unified, single view encompassing both the LAN and security, ensuring a consistent user experience that optimizes operational efficiency while simplifying management, optimization, and troubleshooting. This activity results in a reduced mean time to repair for both network and security issues.
